# Questions:

#### a)
My approach to the Binary Tree Lab "Problem" was to not over complicate the
individual functions that contribute to the Binary Tree properties as a whole.
This lab reminded me a lot of 220 and the pointer manipulation and tracking we
have to do when it comes to linked lists and nodes.

#### b)
The time complexities of my algorithms
Insert: O(h[n]) or O(height of the tree)
Search: same as Insert because traversal to leaf
Delete: same as Insert and Delete however, you pay the cost of O(n) where n is
the number of nodes in the tree

#### c)
Yes.

#### d)
My code can always be improved. Each and every week I find new problems in the
way I code and my code quality. However, I do not have enough time to practice
these code ethics to their full extent due to my attention needing to be in other
places however, with that being said, I always try to research the topics in lab
and projects on my own time to gain a deeper understanding of these data structures.
