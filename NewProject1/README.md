# Project 1 

## How to run?
First type <code>make</code>
Then this will create two executables
1. <code>iomodel</code>
2. <code>driver</code>

## Iomodel
Iomodel takes a command line argument when it runs which is the file of data
that you would like to insert into the input/output model. 
For example <code>./iomodel example.dat</code> will run the iomodel
executable with the example.dat file and extract the data from the example.dat
file and use it to produce a demand report using Matrix operations via 
io model provided in the project instructions'

## Driver
Driver is my program used to test Matrix operations that were used in the
iomodel as well as various other Matrix operations that test
identity matrix, addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.

## Input File Syntax
In order for this program / project to work, you must have your input file
in this exact format.

### data.dat file format:

Companies

Matrix

Demand Vector
