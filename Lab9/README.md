# Questions

#### A)
My approach to this problem was to understand the red black tree properties and make sure my functions were in line with the rules of a red black tree in order to always keep the property. This is why the fixing functions are so important, they allow us to perform functions while having the piece of mind that we will keep the property of the tree. With that being said, there are a lot of edge cases we must take care of in order for that to happen. 

#### B)
The theoretical time complexity of my insert, search, and delete functions are O(log_2(n)) + O(1). In the case of this lab, the tree is almost always completely balances and therefore we can assume that we are obtaining the best case.

#### C)
Yes

#### D)
