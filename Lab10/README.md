# Lab 10

# Questions

### a)
My approach to this problem was to apply what I had learned in class through the lectures, as well as previous knowledge I had on graphs and pathfinding in C++. I enjoy this topic very much and would like to pursue it further. Although I do not usually work with vectors and maps in C++, I did not find it very hard to research the syntax I needed in order to complete this lab.

### b)
The best case would be if every node in the graph was connected to the node in which you are searching for so that you do not have to traverse the graph, instead you can just find the desired node as it is already connected to any node in which you start at, this would take O(1). The worst case would be O(n), this would happen when you have to search every other node in the graph until you find the node you are searching for. 


### c)
The code could be improved if we were looking for a faster, more efficient algorithm to use to find a node in a graph.
There are much more efficient algorithms like a*, dfs, etc. It just depends on the situation you need to use each one.
I think if I had more time to work with the syntax of C++ like mapping, vectors, pairs, etc. I would be able to grasp the idea in more context as I had not worked with these much before now.
