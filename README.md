## Projects

### Wassily Leontief's Input-Output Model (Applied Linear Algebra)

Notable Features & Algorithms:
- Matrix Data Structure & Formatting.
- General Matrix Operations: add/subtract, matrix multiplication, scalar multiplication.
- Strassen's Algorithm for matrix multiplication.
- Matrix Inversion (Co-Factor & Determinant calculations for determining singularity).
- See the README for more information.

### Spell Checker based on a Hashed Dictionary (Hash Table & SpellCheck)

Notable Features & Algorithms:
- Hash Table with Chaining (doubly list).
- A self-made Hashing function.
- Python Script made to find prime numbers for my hash.
- Spell Checking (parsed string) within 1 & 2 edit distances.
- Highlights incorrect words then displays suggestions.

### Knight Random Walk (Random Walk on 2D Graphs)

The Problem: given an 8x8 chess board, and a knight in any corner of the board, if the knight randomly walks through the board, what is the average number of moves expected until the knight returns to its starting position?  This problem sounds like a useless one, but I would say it is actually a great introduction to 2-Dimensional Graph Random Walks.  You don't even have to be good at chess to understand this.  In this project, with simulations and mathematical analysis, we come to an average of 168 moves before the knight returns to its origin.

Notable Features & Algorithms:
- Templated Graph Class.
- An algorithm to create a chess board graph. (edges are only knight moves)
- An algorithm to run, simulate, collect data on a random walk.
- An indepth analysis on the problem and its solution.
