# Project 2 Spell Checker

## How to run?
To run my program, you need an english.txt file. If you have this file,
you can do the following command <code>make</code> this will create an executable which can be ran by doing <code>./run english.txt</code>
Without the english.txt file, this program will not work. It does not have to be named english.txt, but it needs to be ran as a command line argument when running the program.

## What does it do?
This program is a Spell Check program that takes a dictionary or "english.txt" file, full of words and inserts them into a Hash Table to be used as a reference for words used in a sentence or paragraph. Then, the program will prompt you to enter a word, phrase, sentence, or paragraph you would like to have spell checked. My program will return the misspelled words and return a list of suggestions as to what this word could be replaced with based on the words from the dictionary in my Hash Table.
